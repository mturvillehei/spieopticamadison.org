## About

Our goal is to help connect students all over campus with the resources they need for future development through seminars, industry outings and informal gatherings. Students from every discipline are encouraged and welcome to help shape this newly reformed organization! You need not even be a member of SPIE.

Our group’s membership is comprised of students and faculty from Astronomy, Biomedical Engineering, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics, Medical Physics, Biochemistry, Chemistry and Engineering Mechanics and Aeronautics with an interest in optics and photonics.

Please forward any questions, comments, suggestions to  [spie.optica.uw@gmail.com](mailto:spie.optica.uw@gmail.com).
