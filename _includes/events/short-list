Looks through all pages in pages/events/ and sorts them by year.
Then selects 3 most recent events and lists nearest first.

Outputs a list of links to the events pages, organized under year headers.

NB: relies on events pages to be named in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-*" to be
sorted correctly, and to generate the year headers consistently.
