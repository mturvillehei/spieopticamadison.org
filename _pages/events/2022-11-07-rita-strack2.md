Rita’s talk will begin by introducing Nature Methods and their editorial criteria. She will then offer tips for publishing high-quality papers, with an emphasis on microscopy and image analysis. Next, she will switch gears to discuss her views of the future of bioimaging and bioimage analysis. Finally, she will conclude with a short discussion on current trends in promoting reproducibility and reporting in microscopy.

Rita Strack obtained her PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Chicago. While there, she worked with Benjamin Glick and Robert Keenan to engineer improved variants of the red fluorescent protein DsRed (seen above), and also studied the chemical mechanism of chromophore formation in DsRed. She continued her research as a postdoctoral fellow in Samie Jaffrey’s laboratory at Weill Cornell Medical College, where she developed fluorescent reporters for live-cell imaging of RNA such as Spinach2. She handles imaging, microscopy and probes, along with protein and RNA biochemistry content for the journal. Rita joined Nature Methods in November 2014.
